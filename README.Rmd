**POPulation IMmunity**

This repository contains functions to run a demographic model of
vaccine exposure over time, tracking the vaccine-derived immunity by
age through time, following implementation of one or more vaccination
activities that can target the population as a whole or selectively
target specific age groups.

## Documentation

* For an illustration of how the package is used check the [main vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/popim/articles/popim.html).
* You can find more information about the underlying algorithms are in the [technical vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/popim/articles/technical_doc.html)

## Installation

You can install the development version of popim from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/popim")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep -->
<!-- `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for -->
<!-- this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` -->
<!-- every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: -->
<!-- <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure -->
<!-- files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
