<p>The intention of the package <code>popim</code> is to provide tools
to easily evaluate and track the POPulation IMmunity of an
age-structured population that results from vaccination. Given that
vaccination has long lasting effects, this requires tracking the status
of the population through time.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data-structures">Data structures<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-structures"></a>
</h2>
<p>To this end the package defines two S3 classes to store data in an
appropriate format. Both classes are dataframes, but have additional
requirements such as certain columns that must be present, and the
format and range of these columns.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="s3-class-popim_population">S3 class <code>popim_population</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#s3-class-popim_population"></a>

information on a population of interest.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-dataframe">The dataframe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-dataframe"></a>
</h4>
<p>The dataframe holds information on the population size and immunity
status of the population through time. The population is disaggregated
into 1-year age groups, and potentially several spatial regions. Each
row refers to a particular (1 year) birth cohort in a given location and
year.</p>
<p>The mandatory columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>region</code>: The population of interest may be spatially
disaggregated into separate geographical regions (e.g., countries or
subnational administrative regions). This column holds a string that
identifies which region each entry refers to.</li>
<li>
<code>year</code>: The population is tracked through time using
annual time steps.</li>
<li>
<code>age</code>: The age-structure of the population is tracked in
annual age groups.</li>
<li>
<code>cohort</code>: This column is redundant as it equals
<code>year</code> - <code>age</code>, and therefore refers to the year
in which this cohort was born. It is included for ease of handling.</li>
<li>
<code>immunity</code>: Gives the proportion of each cohort that is
immune due to past vaccination.</li>
<li>
<code>pop_size</code>: Number of people in any given age group and
year. To facilitate using common units such as thousands this is not
limited to integer values. It is however up to the user to ensure that
such units are used consistently.</li>

<p>If the target population size is known, the information on coverage
and doses is redundant (and potentially conflicting) as coverage = doses
/ target population size. However, the
<code>popim_vacc_activities</code> object does not store information on
population size, this is held in the <code>popim_population</code>
object to which the vaccination activities will be applied, so this
potential conflict cannot be detected in a
<code>popim_vacc_activities</code> object in isolation. The validator
for this class, <code>validate_vacc_activities()</code>, checks that the
required columns exist and are of correct data type and range (where
applicatble). It also currently requires that at least one of
<code>coverage</code> and <code>doses</code> is non-missing in each
column. <em>(This behaviour is maybe not sensible as inconsistent with
the other columns?)</em></p>

<p>Once objects holding data on the population and vaccination
activities have been set up, the primary functionality provided by
<code>popim</code> is to apply the vaccination activities to the
population to evaluate the population immunity by age over time that
results from the given vaccination activities, which is done with the

</h3>
<ul>
<li>100% vaccine effectiveness</li>
<li>no wastage of doses</li>
<li>no waning immunity</li>
<li>mortality is independent of immunity status</li>
</ul>
<p>While the first two are clearly unrealistic assumptions, if there is
a constant vaccine effectiveness (&lt;100%), or a constant wastage
factor, the results can easily be scaled up by these constant factors to
obtain more realistic values for vaccine demand.</p>
<p>For a potentially deadly disease one would expect that mortality due
to the disease would be strongly correlated with immunity status,
however, even the most devastating outbreaks typically only affect a
small part of the population, and therefore all-cause mortality will be
much less impacted by mortality due to the specific disease. This means
that this assumption is closer to reality than it might appear at
first.</p>
<p>Waning immunity is a potentially important factor to consider for
many vaccines, particularly when looking at the long term benefits of
vaccination. However, allowing for this is currently not
implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="description-of-the-algorithm">Description of the algorithm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#description-of-the-algorithm"></a>
</h3>
<p>The vaccination activities object has columns for
<code>coverage</code>, the proportion of the target population that will
be vaccinated, and <code>doses</code>, the number of vaccine doses to be
administered in the activity. Given a target population size this is
redundant (and potentially conflicting) information. The function
<code><a href="../reference/apply_vacc.html">apply_vacc()</a></code> will always use <code>coverage</code>
information in preference over <code>doses</code>, if this is
non-missing. If <code>coverage</code> is missing, the target population
size (based on the population size of the region and age groups
targeted) will be calculated and the corresponding <code>coverage</code>
calculated as <code>doses</code> / <code>target_population</code>.</p>
<p>While the function <code><a href="../reference/apply_vacc.html">apply_vacc()</a></code> will calculate the
coverage if it is missing with respect to the target population size,
without modifying the input <code>popim_vacc_activities</code> object,
the function <code><a href="../reference/complete_vacc_activities.html">complete_vacc_activities()</a></code> will fill in
missing coverage and doses information from the other, and check for
inconsistencies in activities that have both data on
<code>coverage</code> and <code>doses</code>. This is done with respect
to a particular <code>popim_population</code> object which contains the
relevant population sizes.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="vaccinating-a-cohort-with-no-previous-immunity">Vaccinating a cohort with no previous immunity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vaccinating-a-cohort-with-no-previous-immunity"></a>
</h4>
<p>When vaccination is applied to a particular birth cohort that has no
immunity, the result is simply that the proportion of the cohort
receiving the vaccine will be immune from the time of the vaccination
onwards, i.e., the immunity for this cohort will be set to equal the
coverage of the vaccination activity in question. Due to the annual time
step, vaccination is assumed to take effect at the end of the year in
which it is implemented, so the immunity is updated from the next year
onwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="vaccinating-a-cohort-with-previous-immunity">Vaccinating a cohort with previous immunity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vaccinating-a-cohort-with-previous-immunity"></a>
</h4>
<p>When a vaccination activity is applied to a cohort that has some
previous immunity, we need to make some assumptions about who will be
vaccinated in the new activity. There are 3 different options
implemented which are governed by the parameter <code>targeting</code>,
one of the input parameters to the function <code><a href="../reference/apply_vacc.html">apply_vacc()</a></code>.
This parameter can take the values <code>"targeted"</code>,
<code>"random"</code> or <code>"correlated"</code>.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="targeted-targeting">
<code>"targeted"</code> targeting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#targeted-targeting"></a>
</h5>
<p>The most effective way to implement a new vaccination activity is to
use <code>"targeted"</code> targeting, meaning that the vaccine is
targeted at previously non-immunised individuals. This means that the
new immunity of after the vaccination activity is simply the sum of the
previous immunity and the coverage of the current vaccination activity
(capped by 1 which indicates complete immunity of the cohort in
question):</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\rm{immunity}_{\rm new} =
\min(\rm{immunity}_{\rm prev} + \rm{coverage}, 1)$$</span></p>
<p>While this is not a realistic assumption in many settings, it can be
useful for instance in multi-year campaigns that target the same region
(but possibly proceed sub-region by sub-region) over several years. This
multi-year campaign would be coded as separate vaccination activities
for each year, using the option <code>targeting</code> =
<code>"targeted"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="random-targeting">
<code>"random"</code> targeting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#random-targeting"></a>
</h5>
<p>A reasonable first assumption might be to use <code>targeting</code>
= <code>"random"</code>, meaning that individuals will receive
vaccination irrespective of their previous immunity status. The immunity
after the new campaign is applied is calculated according to</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
\rm{immunity}_{\rm new} =
\rm{coverage} + \rm{immunity}_{\rm prev} -
\rm{coverage}*\rm{immunity}_{\rm prev}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="correlated-targeting">
<code>"correlated"</code> targeting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#correlated-targeting"></a>
</h5>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is the most pessimistic
assumption that might apply in situations where there is unequal access
to vaccination: under <code>"correlated"</code> targeting, people who
have previously been immunised get vaccinated first in the new
vaccination activity, and those previously not immune will only receive
any vaccine if the new coverage extends further:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
\rm{immunity}_{\rm new} =
\max(\rm{immunity}_{\rm prev}, \rm{coverage})$$</span></p>
<p>Note that the order in which vaccination activities are applied to a
population does not matter under any of the <code>targeting</code>
assumptions.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-inverse-inferring-vaccination-activities-from-a-population">The inverse: inferring vaccination activities from a population<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-inverse-inferring-vaccination-activities-from-a-population"></a>
</h3>
<p>It is not possible to infer the vaccination activities that have
given rise to a particular immunity profile of a population by age and
over time: The same profile can be reached with different
<code>targeting</code> choices (where different <code>targeting</code>
choices will require different amount of vaccine). Furthermore, if there
are cohorts that reached 100% immunity, there may have been double
vaccination of some individuals that left no trace in the immunity
profile. However, the function <code><a href="../reference/vacc_from_immunity.html">vacc_from_immunity()</a></code> does
infer the vaccination activities from a population immunity profile as
far as possible, returning an obejct of class
<code>popim_vacc_activities</code>.</p>
<p>To this end, in addition to passing the <code>popim_population</code>
object of interest, the user needs to specify a <code>targeting</code>
option (which will be assumed for all vaccination activities that are
identified). The inferred vaccination activities will be the minimal
activities possible to give rise to the observed immunity profile given
the <code>targeting</code> option supplied.</p>

<h2 id="population-summary-visualisation">Population summary &amp; visualisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#population-summary-visualisation"></a>
</h2>
<p>An object of class <code>popim_population</code> holds a somewhat
complex dataset recording population size, age distribution and immunity
status through time, and potentially disaggregated into various
geographical regions. To facilitate interpretation of this kind of data,
there are a couple of functions to aggregate and visualise these
objects.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="visualisation">Visualisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#visualisation"></a>
</h3>
<p>The functions <code><a href="../reference/plotting.html">plot_pop_size()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/plotting.html">plot_immunity()</a></code> serve to plot the age-disaggregated
population size and immunity through time in a grid where year and age
are plotted on the x- and y-axis, respectively. The size of the cohort
or proportion of the cohort that is immune is indicated by the colour of
the grid cell. If there are several regions, these will be shown in
separate panels.</p>
<p>The implementation of these plot functions is based on ggplot2, and
therefore the returned plot objects can be further modified using the
ggplot2 syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="aggregation-over-age">Aggregation over age<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#aggregation-over-age"></a>
</h3>
<p>While the age structure of a populationâ€™s immunity profile is
important to understand how immunity is likely to develop through time,
for the purposes of understanding how well a population is protected at
any point in time, often the overall proportion immune is of greater
interest. This can be calculated using the function
<code><a href="../reference/calc_pop_immunity.html">calc_pop_immunity()</a></code> which will aggregate the population
over age and return a dataframe with the whole population immunity over
time and geographical region.</p>
